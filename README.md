# python

This is the encoding of Polar Codes based on the video of Prof. Andrew Thangaraj (www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b2z6bua0xY). In that video, Prof. Andrew is using Matlab and I would like to create it in Python. But in generating the Polar Codes is different from the method used by Prof. Andrew, he is using a calculation based on a tree representation of Polar Codes. And in this code, I am using the basic operation which is to multiply the Codeword with the Generator Matrix and do XOR operation of each element (for more clarity, you can check it to Prof. Erdal Arikan's paper)
Any advice to make this program better is welcomed
